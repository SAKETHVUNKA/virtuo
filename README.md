## 💡 Problem Statement

Traditional teaching methods rely heavily on lectures, textbooks, and static images, which often fail to engage students fully. As a result, many students lose interest in STEM subjects, leading to lower performance and reduced motivation to pursue STEM careers.

Additionally, distractions from mobile devices during study sessions further impact concentration and productivity.
